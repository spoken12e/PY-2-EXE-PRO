## 2. Python Obfuscation and EXE Conversion Tool
This tool allows you to obfuscate a Python script, embed its hash for integrity checking, and convert it into an executable (.exe) file using PyInstaller. The obfuscation is achieved by compressing the Python script and encoding it in base85, making it harder for someone to directly read the original code. Additionally, the tool verifies the integrity of the executable by embedding a SHA256 hash of the file, ensuring that the file hasn't been tampered with.

- Script Obfuscation: Compress and encode your Python script to protect the original code from easy inspection.
- Executable Creation: Convert your obfuscated script into a standalone .exe file using PyInstaller.
- Integrity Verification: Embed a SHA256 hash within the executable to check the file's integrity and prevent tampering.
- Customizable Output: Optionally specify an icon and output directory for the executable.
- GUI Interface: User-friendly GUI built with tkinter to make the process easy and intuitive.
